{"id":"NK-6q9nyg","title":"Refactor HTTP-dependent functions for testability","description":"Several functions use http.Get or external libraries directly (GetFullContent uses goose, ResolveFeedURL uses http.Get + goquery, imageProxyHandler uses http.Client). Refactor these to accept interfaces for HTTP fetching so they can be unit tested with mocks. This is the primary blocker for reaching 90% coverage.","type":"task","status":"open","priority":2,"labels":null,"assignee":"","created":"2026-02-13T03:54:37.630148644Z","updated":"2026-02-13T03:54:37.630148644Z"}

The remaining untested functions are: GetFullContent (goose HTTP extraction), indexHandler/serveBoxedFile (rice.MustFindBox), Serve (starts HTTP server), main, util.init. To reach 90%, consider: (1) refactoring GetFullContent to accept an interface for HTTP fetching, (2) refactoring Serve to extract route setup into a testable function, (3) mocking rice.MustFindBox, (4) using feeds from https://trenchant.org/feeds.txt as static test fixtures for integration tests.","type":"task","status":"open","priority":3,"labels":null,"assignee":"","created":"2026-02-13T03:54:30.298141982Z","updated":"2026-02-13T03:54:30.298141982Z"}
